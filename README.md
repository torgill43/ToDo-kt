# Overview

Purpose: Learn Kotlin basics by creating a simple to-do list program.

Description: To-Do list program developed in Kotlin. Add to, edit, or delete from your list to make sure you stay on top of your tasks, or, as you can see in my video linked below, your top cereals to eat.

# Useful Websites

- [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/kotlin-programming)
- [YouTube - Coding In Flow](https://www.youtube.com/@codinginflow)
- [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com)
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)
  - Some documentation or tutorials were sparse for certain things. This helped me specifically with reading and writing to files.

# Future Work

- Add elements specific to To-Do lists rather than generic lists
- Convert to Android app
- Add functionality such as date to complete by or priorities
